# ContactsApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.7.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Back-end

this code uses backend as REST service. This is available in git (url:https://github.com/Priyankadhavale/ContactAppAPI.git).
This needs to run before running angular application.

I have used SQL server as backend . Adding the mdb file of DB along with this API so that on restore will be able to access the data.
